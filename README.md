# Knowledge-Based AI Agent using Propositional Logic 🧠

This project demonstrates how a simple **AI reasoning system** can make logical inferences using stored knowledge and propositional rules.  
It uses **Python (Flask)** for backend, **HTML + CSS** for frontend, and **SQLite** as the local database.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This web-based AI agent acts as a small **expert system**.  
It stores knowledge as *if–then rules* and facts in a database.  
When the user provides facts, the AI uses propositional logic to derive possible conclusions based on matching rules.
